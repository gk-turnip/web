<h1>Project Management</h1>
<h2>Tactical</h2>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>get the web site to a resonable state</li>
    <li>get a "docs" to "web" link setup up such that the web site has links to all the documents in the "docs" repository</li>
    <li>create a test client 3d program to test out the 3d client technology.  We are thinking that we would not need more than 30 fps refresh on our client during a typlical "Gourdian Knot" view.  We don't know what the lower acceptable limit should be.  Also we are guessing that we need 6,000 moving triangles and 6,000 stationary triangles in a typical "Gourdian Knot" view. Once we have a test client program with 12,000 triangles we can get people to try it out on various systems, browsers and devices to see what frame rates will be like.</li>
		<li>create a small demo game, details <a href="http://www.gourdianknot.com/game_starter.php">here</a>.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
